Deploy to XDC Apothem Network + Secured by CIVIC Pass.

WEB3GPT simplifies smart contract deployment. Users input Solidity code into the Chat GPT interface and the tool handles the rest. It's a user-friendly, interactive asset for XDC Solidity development.

## Project Description

The WEB3GPT plugin, operating without user authentication, offers easy access and secure handling of user data through a locally hosted open API. It simplifies the management of XDC contracts with key features:

- **Contract Addition**: Enables users to add new contracts, aiding in tracking various contracts of interest.
- **Contract Removal**: Allows users to delete irrelevant or unneeded contracts from their list.
- **Contract Viewing**: Provides a comprehensive overview of all user contracts for easy management.

In essence, WEB3GPT is an invaluable asset for anyone in the XDC sphere, streamlining interactions with smart contracts.

## How it's Made

WEB3GPT is a unique project that leverages ChatGPT Plugins, NextJS, Ethers.js, and solc.js to create a conversational interface for managing XDC contracts. The GPT-4 model, powered by OpenAI, provides an interactive user experience, while NextJS ensures an efficient and scalable frontend. Ethers.js handles XDC interactions, and solc.js compiles Solidity code within the application. The integration of these technologies allows users to manage contracts through natural language conversations, making the process more accessible and user-friendly. The innovative use of GPT-4 Plugins to manage XDC contracts is a notable feature of this project.
