## Project Description

The Web3 GPT-4 plugin, operating without user authentication, offers easy access and secure handling of user data through a locally hosted open API. It simplifies the management of blockchain contracts with key features:

- **Contract Addition**: Enables users to add new contracts, aiding in tracking various contracts of interest.
- **Contract Removal**: Allows users to delete irrelevant or unneeded contracts from their list.
- **Contract Viewing**: Provides a comprehensive overview of all user contracts for easy management.

In essence, Web3 GPT-4 is an invaluable asset for anyone in the blockchain sphere, streamlining interactions with smart contracts.

## How it's Made

Web3 GPT-4 is a unique project that leverages Chat GPT-4 Plugins, NextJS, Ethers.js, and solc.js to create a conversational interface for managing blockchain contracts. The GPT-4 model, powered by OpenAI, provides an interactive user experience, while NextJS ensures an efficient and scalable frontend. Ethers.js handles Ethereum blockchain interactions, and solc.js compiles Solidity code within the application. The integration of these technologies allows users to manage contracts through natural language conversations, making the process more accessible and user-friendly. The innovative use of GPT-4 Plugins to manage blockchain contracts is a notable feature of this project.
